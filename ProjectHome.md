## Google Wave gadgets and robots in active developpement ##

The first one is _**Voicy**_, a voice recording system gadget. A new way to share thoughts, greetings and something more than emoticons, in Google Wave. Record up to 10mins sound clips (video coming later), and play them back.

The second one is a little robot, _**mywaveid**_ which, as its name implies, extracts the wave's id and prints it at the bottom of the wave.
